<h1 style="color: #5e9ca0;">C++ argument passing</h1>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">The problems</h2>
<p>1. Unpacking a sum type using structured binding is not type safe.</p>
<p>The contract provided by the type is the types of the members, their names and the order of evaluation of their initializer sub-expressions.</p>
<p>Structured binding only captures the number of members and their order of evaluation, but not the types or names of the members.</p>
<p>2. In C++17, in order to mimic multiple return value functions, users either create a one-time only struct or use a tuple.</p>
<p>Both these approaches have drawbacks:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; a. Tuples provide a narrow contract - no member names are given.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; b. structs used solely  for packing a "named tuple" provide a wide contract - the layout is part of the contract. </p>
<p>In both cases non-copyable types for members are impossible as copy elision is forbidden in these cases due to the intermediate struct</p>    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">The solution</h2>
<p>1. Introduce a new rule for unpacking a sum type that requires the user to know the names of the arguments.</p>
<p>This paper's approach: </p>
<pre><qoute> Types which are not visible but reachable, unpacked in a structured binding declaration, must use the right names of the members.</qoute></pre>
<pre><code>
module lib;

struct result_t { // not exported
    int a;
    int b;
};
export result_t foo();

module user;
import lib;

void bar() {

//    auto[b, a] = foo(); // Error: wrong names

    auto[a, b] = foo(); // OK

    auto[a1 = .a, b1 = .b] = foo(); // OK

//    auto[b2 = .b, a2 = .a] = foo(); // Error: Wrong order

}
</code></pre>
<p>2. Introduce a syntax to create anonymous sum types concepts.</p>
<pre><code>
module lib;

export auto foo() -> [int .a, int .b] {
    return {.a = 4, .b = 2};
}
</code></pre>

<p>The `[]` expression evaluates to an unnamed concept with the given member names and order (but no layout is mandated).</p>
<p>3. Designated initializer evaluate to an unnamed type bound to the given concept.</p>
<pre><code>
double radius(auto [double .x, double .y] cartesian) { //short-hand concept syntax for templated function
    auto[x, y] = cartesian;
    return std::sqrt(x * x + y * y);
}

double radius(auto [double .r, double .theta] polar) {
    return polar.r;
}

double baz()
{
    return radius({.x = 3.0, .y = 4.0});
}
</code></pre>
